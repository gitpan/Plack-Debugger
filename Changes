Revision history for Perl extension Plack::Debugger

0.01 Monday, 10 November 2014
    - First release to an unsuspecting world (well, 
      not really unsuspecting, I promised this would
      go out at the London Perl Workshop then took 
      two days to do it, so really it is to a suspecting
      world, but that doesn't sound as fun).
