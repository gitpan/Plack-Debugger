    # context is finished. Since we have 
    # more distinct phases of execution here
    # and not just a wrapping, we can't do 
    # that. Exactly how much I need to care
    # about this is unkwown to me, so I will
    # just leave this as is for now.
    # Patches welcome!

=head1 NAME

Plack::Debugger::Panel::Warnings - Debug panel for viewing warnings called during a request

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Plack::Debugger::Panel> subclass that will capture any 
warnings triggered during the request. 

=head2 CAVEAT

This uses the C<$SIG{__WARN__}> handler to accomplish its task in 
what is quite likely a naive way, if you care enough to fix this, 
please take a look at the source and submit a patch.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENT

This module was originally developed for Booking.com. With approval 
from Booking.com, this module was generalized and published on CPAN,
